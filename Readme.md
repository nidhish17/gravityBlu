## Known Issues
- [x] ~~Fix a minor bug: downloading two videos with the same ID causes their progress trackers to collide,
this will be addressed in a future release.~~

- [x] ~~if user changes quality then the downloaded video is not the same quality the user chose even if the
video's res is available ie due to init/variable being read during init phase and that being accessed everytime and not the current quality that the user selected!~~

- [ ] sometimes video download just doesn't start you might have to re-try.
  - SABR forcing error
  - formats skipped due to SABR

## Dev Notes
### ‚ö†Ô∏è üëΩüëΩüëΩüß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üê¶‚Äçüî• ALWAYS REMEMBER TO UPDATE THE "__ VERSION __" VARIABLE ELSE UPDATING FEATURE WILL NOT WORK ‚ö†Ô∏è
- [x] implement updating feature to app
- [ ]

## Guidelines for releases for updater to work
1. tag name should be in the format 2.0.0 -> x.x.x
2. first release of the app version is 2.0.0
3. for later releases depending on the complexity of update name 2.x.x
4. for small features and bug fixes increment 2.0.x
5. for major updates increment 2.x.0 or x.0.0

# while uploading the exe to github for update the tag name should be a new one and it shoould match the new version so the fix works
